# VectorVision
 

This project leverages a **YOLO-based machine vision system** to recognize matrices and perform matrix arithmetic. The model is trained on custom datasets created from the **MNIST dataset** and deployed using **Roboflow**.

## Features

- **Matrix Detection**: Recognizes matrices using a machine vision system.
- **Matrix Arithmetic**: Performs addition, determinant, and other operations on detected matrices.
- **Custom Dataset**: Utilizes custom datasets derived from **MNIST** for specialized training.
- **YOLO-based Model**: Employs the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: A state-of-the-art machine vision system for fast object detection.
- **Roboflow**: For dataset preprocessing and model deployment.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Modified to create custom datasets for training the model.
